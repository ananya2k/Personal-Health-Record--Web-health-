The PHR is a tool that you can use to collect, track and share past and current  information about your health or the health of someone in your care. PHRs are user- friendly, online solutions that give patients a way to manage their own health  information. The PHR contains data about the allergies, medications and illness including hospitalizations, surgeries/procedures, vaccinations, laboratory test results, family history and social history for an individual. Even when routine procedures do need to be repeated, your PHR can give medical care providers more insight into your personal health story.
